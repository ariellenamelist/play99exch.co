    <p>
      You can't remember your Play99Exch customer ID, then. Isn't that annoying? To be honest, though, it's not that difficult to get it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hereâ€™s what you have to do:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Launch WhatsApp and contact Play99Exch customer support. On the Play99Exch website, you can click the WhatsApp icon directly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simply type: "My Play99Exch ID is gone."
      </li>
      <li>
        A member of the support staff will get in touch with you and request your complete name and the WhatsApp number you used to register.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our customer service team will send you information within five minutes without requiring any authentication if you contact us using the same WhatsApp phone you used to create your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        They will send your customer ID to your registered mobile number or via WhatsApp as soon as they verify that it is indeed you.
