      <p>
        <b>Withdrawing Funds</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you considering cashing out? To start your withdrawal, you must have at least ₹100 in your Play99Exch account. This is how funds are deposited into your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> In the upper right corner, select your Customer ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> Select Withdrawal from the menu now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> Enter the desired withdrawal amount.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> Select your payout option after clicking the Withdrawal button.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> You must input your bank information with the IFSC code or your UPI ID if this is your first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/box.jpg" alt="DesignBox" className="img-fluid box-ic" /> Press "Verify Withdrawal."
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Although Play99Exch offers a variety of payout options, UPI is by far the quickest. Withdrawals made using UPI typically take effect in five minutes. Additionally, it may take up to four hours if you have selected bank transfer.
